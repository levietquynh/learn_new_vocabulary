        code .   -> Open visual code, create and enter data
        git status    -> To know the modified status information before performing the commit
        git add gitCMD.txt     -> Add all file in folder to commit
        git commit -m "Report git cmd"   -> To save data to the Git update to the last commit
        git push origin vubr   -> Push a file to vubr branch remote repo
- How to pull a file from remote repo to local
        git pull origin vubr  -> Get information from remote and update to the branch of local repo.
- How to rebase
    rebase: (conflict)
        git checkout master  -> Switch to master branch
        git pull  -> Get information from remote and update to local repo.
        git checkout vubr  -> Switch to master branch
        git rebase master   -> Yo reapply new commits in one branch on top of another branch.
        code .  -> resolve conflict
        git add gitCMD.txt     -> Add all file in folder to commit
        git commit -m "new"
        git push origin --force vubr   -> Branch override
